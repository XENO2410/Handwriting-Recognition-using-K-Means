# Handwriting Recognition using K-Means

## Overview
The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999 to process roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day. This technology is not limited to the postal service:

- ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks
- Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists
- Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts

But how do they do it?

In this project, we will use K-means clustering and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits.

## Objectives
1. Implement K-means clustering to recognize handwritten digits.
2. Use scikit-learn to preprocess and cluster the images.
3. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.

## Datasets
We will use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which is available in scikit-learn.

## Tasks
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the MNIST dataset from scikit-learn.
   - Preprocess the data to make it suitable for clustering.

2. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Implement the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Fit the model to the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Visualize the clustered images and their corresponding centroids.

## Extensions
- Experiment with different numbers of clusters and compare their performance.
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA before clustering.
- Use other clustering algorithms and compare their results with K-means.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Conclusion
Through this project, you will understand how K-means clustering can be used to recognize handwritten digits, similar to the technology used by the U.S. Postal Service, ATMs, Evernote, and Expensify.
